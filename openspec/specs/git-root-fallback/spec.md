# git-root-fallback Specification

## Purpose
Enable the OpenSpec status widget to detect the `openspec/changes` directory even when pi is launched from a subdirectory of a git repository, by first checking the current working directory and then falling back to the git repository root.

## Requirements

### Requirement: OpenSpec directory resolution
The extension SHALL resolve the `openspec/changes` directory by first checking the current working directory, then falling back to the git repository root. Once resolved, the path SHALL be cached for the remainder of the session.

#### Scenario: Current working directory has openspec/changes
- **WHEN** pi is launched from a directory that contains `openspec/changes/`
- **THEN** the extension uses that directory for all CLI invocations and file reads
- **AND** no git command is executed

#### Scenario: Current working directory lacks openspec/changes but git root has it
- **WHEN** pi is launched from a subdirectory of a git repository
- **AND** the current working directory does not contain `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** the git root directory contains `openspec/changes/`
- **THEN** the extension resolves to the git root and uses `openspec/changes/` from there

#### Scenario: Neither current directory nor git root has openspec/changes
- **WHEN** pi is launched from a directory that does not contain `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** either there is no git repository OR the git root also lacks `openspec/changes/`
- **THEN** the extension behaves as if no OpenSpec project is present (widget does not render)

#### Scenario: Git is not installed
- **WHEN** pi is launched from a subdirectory that does not contain `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** the `git` command is not available on PATH
- **THEN** the extension treats the project as non-existent (same as current behavior when launched from a non-project directory)

#### Scenario: Path is cached for the session
- **WHEN** the resolved `openspec/changes` directory path is determined on first use
- **THEN** subsequent CLI invocations and file reads within the same session reuse the cached path without re-checking or re-invoking git

### Requirement: CLI commands target the resolved directory
All `openspec` CLI invocations and file reads SHALL use the resolved `openspec/changes` directory as their working directory or path prefix.

#### Scenario: openspec list uses resolved directory
- **WHEN** the extension calls `openspec list --json`
- **THEN** the command runs with the resolved directory as the working directory (via `cwd` option)

#### Scenario: openspec status uses resolved directory
- **WHEN** the extension calls `openspec status --json --change <name>`
- **THEN** the command runs with the resolved directory as the working directory

#### Scenario: tasks.md read uses resolved directory
- **WHEN** the extension reads a change's `tasks.md` file
- **THEN** the file path is constructed as `<resolvedDir>/<changeName>/tasks.md`

### Requirement: Resolution failure is non-disruptive
When the directory resolution fails (no git, not a repo, no `openspec/changes` anywhere), the extension SHALL fall back gracefully to the existing error handling behavior without crashing, hanging, or disrupting the pi session.

#### Scenario: Git command times out
- **WHEN** the `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` command does not complete within the timeout
- **THEN** the extension proceeds as if git is not available and treats the project as non-existent

#### Scenario: Git command returns unexpected output
- **WHEN** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` succeeds but returns output that is not a valid directory path
- **THEN** the extension treats it as a resolution failure and falls back to the no-project state
