# pi-openspec-status

[![Publish workflow](https://github.com/mattoopie/pi-openspec-status/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mattoopie/pi-openspec-status/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-openspec-status.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-openspec-status)

A [pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent extension that displays the active OpenSpec change status as a persistent TUI widget above the editor, with an interactive dialog for detailed views.

## Features

- **Persistent TUI widget** — always visible above the editor in interactive mode, automatically suppressed in non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--json`, headless RPC)
- **Single-change detailed view** — when one active change exists, shows the change name, schema, per-artifact status (proposal, design, specs, tasks), and a task progress bar with apply dependency hints
- **Multi-change overview** — when multiple active changes exist, shows a header with the active count followed by one condensed line per change with artifact initials, task counters, and blocked-dependency hints
- **Artifact status indicators** — uses filled circle (●) for done, open circle (○) for ready, and dotted circle (◌) for blocked, each colored with theme-aware success/muted/warning colors
- **Interactive dialog** — press `Ctrl+Alt+O` to open a scrollable dialog with full change details, task breakdowns, and dependency info
- **Automatic data refresh** — fetches from the `openspec` CLI on session start, after each agent turn/end (debounced 500ms), when tools write to `openspec/` or bash commands reference openspec, plus a fallback refresh every 30 seconds
- **Error resilience** — gracefully shows "CLI not found" when openspec is unavailable, silently no-ops when not in an OpenSpec project, and retains last-known state with a muted error indicator on CLI failures

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-openspec-status
```

Or with a specific version:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-openspec-status@0.5.3
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mattoopie/pi-openspec-status
```

Or with a specific version:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mattoopie/pi-openspec-status@v0.5.3
```

## Usage

Once installed, the widget appears automatically when you're in a project that has an `openspec/changes/` directory with active change subdirectories.

### Interactive dialog

Press **`Ctrl+Alt+O`** in interactive mode to open a scrollable dialog displaying the full OpenSpec change status. The dialog shows:

- **All active changes** with their artifact completion status
- **Task breakdowns** with completed/total counts per change
- **Dependency information** for blocked artifacts

This is useful when the compact widget above the editor doesn't show enough detail, or when you want to browse through changes in a larger view.

> **Note:** The dialog is only available in interactive mode (it is suppressed in `-p`, `--json`, and headless RPC sessions).

### Requirements

- A project using [OpenSpec](https://github.com/fission-ai/openspec) with changes in `openspec/changes/`
- Each change directory may contain:
  - `.openspec.yaml` — with a `schema` field (optional, defaults to `"spec-driven"`)
  - `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` — artifacts tracked as "done" when present
  - `specs/` — directory tracked as "done" when non-empty

### Display

The widget renders different layouts depending on the number of active changes and available terminal width.

#### No active changes

```
No active OpenSpec changes
```

#### Single active change (3-line detailed view)

```
◷ add-auth (spec-driven)
Artifacts: proposal ● design ○ specs ○ tasks ○
Tasks: ████░░░░░░ 3/7
```

- **Line 1:** Status icon (`✓` when fully complete, `◷` in-progress, `✗` blocked/error), change name, and schema name in parentheses
- **Line 2:** Each artifact (proposal, design, specs, tasks) with a status icon — `●` done (success), `○` ready (muted), `◌` blocked (warning)
- **Line 3:** Task progress bar with completed/total count

#### Multiple active changes (header + condensed lines)

```
OpenSpec (2 active)
◷ add-auth  P ● D ○ S ○ T ○  3/7
✗ bugfix    P ● D ◌ S ○ T ○  0/0  (blocked: design)
```

- **Header:** "OpenSpec (N active)" in accent color
- **Per change (one line):** Status icon, truncated change name, artifact initials (`P`=proposal, `D`=design, `S`=specs, `T`=tasks) each with a status icon, task counter (completed/total), and a blocked-dependency hint when applicable

#### Error states

| Condition | Display |
|-----------|---------|
| OpenSpec CLI not installed | `OpenSpec CLI not found` (warning color, single line) |
| Not an OpenSpec project | Widget does not render (no-op) |
| CLI invocation fails | Retains last known state with muted error indicator |
